title: Installation and Setup
---

## Composer

To install through Composer, by run the following command:

``` bash
composer require nwidart/laravel-modules
```

The package will automatically register a service provider and alias.

Optionally, publish the package's configuration file by running:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nwidart\Modules\LaravelModulesServiceProvider"
```

## Autoloading

By default the module classes are not loaded automatically. You can autoload your modules using `psr-4`. For example :

``` json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\": "app/",
      "Modules\\": "Modules/"
    }
  }
}
```

**Tip: don't forget to run `composer dump-autoload` afterwards**
